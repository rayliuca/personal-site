# Intro

I’m a new grad of the Engineering Physics program of the University of Alberta, which is like a traditional electrical engineering program, but it puts a bit more emphasis on the mathematical and theoretical aspects. This program gave me a closer look into how physics models (Newtonian, quantum, etc. etc.) are made and applied in engineering. The way how we can use models to describe, study, and predict in various applications fascinates me.

# Currently

After finishing my course works, I am planning and have begun to learn some popular tools and work on some projects, such as:

- this website!
- Docker
- Java
- some machine learning projects


# Hobby
Besides the projects I publish, I’m also always working on some small side projects. Playing around with my Ender 3 3D printer and 3018 Pro CNC machine is something that I would do for fun.

　

For example, for the sake of engineering, I design and build a ring box for my iron ring using 3D printed parts, a rubber band, packaging padding, and some super glue. (since the sound of the ring knocking on my tablet is quite stressful)

　

The CNC machine is a new member of the team. I have already milled some printed circuit boards (PCBs) with it. Hopefully, it could expand the variety of fun things I could make.

- I have 2 Shiba Inus, Whale and Dolphin
- I own a Nikon D5100 DSLR camera, which I shot the two aforementioned doges primarily, but sometimes landscapes as well
- Once upon a time, I played western concert flute for 8 years, and now I am trying to pick it up again!
